# Treadmilling-Speed-Analysis
**Automated image analysis protocol to quantify the velocities of dynamic protein filaments**

This approach allows to quantify the velocities of thousands of dynamic treadmilling filaments simultaneously using simple open-spource tools, namely ImageJ plugins and home-built pythn scripts. The approach is divided in three distinct steps:

(a) Construction of differential image stacks to create fluorescent speckles (ImageJ Script) <br>
 ***(short description how the code works)*** <br>
 
(b) Tracking the motion of the fluorescent speckles using TrackMate (ImageJ script) <br>
 ***(short description how the code works)*** <br>
 
(c) Analyze trajectories to quantify velocity and directionality of filaments (Python notebook). <br>

and some other examples of how we implement this approach: ***(ZapA and FtsN paper)***
