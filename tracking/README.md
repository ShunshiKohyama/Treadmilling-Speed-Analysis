# Tracking Flourescent speckles with TrackMate (ImageJ)

In our analysis, we chose to use TrackMate for particle detection and tracking (Tinevez et al. 2016), not only because it is an open-source toolbox available for ImageJ, but also because it provides a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) with several features for visualization and data export. In our analysis, on a first apporach we use TrackMate's GUI to identify the best parameters for detecting, tracking and linking the trajectories of fluorescent speckles. After finding the optimal parameters for detection and tracking, they can then be used in a batch processing step to analyze multiple time-lapse movies without using the GUI. Our macro uses the Laplacian detector (LoG) and set of different filters that we found handy in our analysis. They can of course be set to zero if unecessary.

*running the macro opens an interactive dialogue that allows to select the directory folder and introduce all the necessary parameters (is self-explanatory). TrackMate runs on the background and saves two xml files for each analyzed movie (same directory). The 'TM' file can be load back on imageJ (load TrackMate file option) and check the whole analysis. The xml file contains all the coordenates and temporal info for each particle and trajectory. This second file is then used as input for the last step of the analysis.*
